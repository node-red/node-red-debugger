        This issue tracker is for problems with the Node-RED Flow Debugger

        If your issue is:
          - a general 'how-to' type question,
          - a feature request or suggestion for a change,
          - or problems with 3rd party (`node-red-contrib-`) nodes

        please use the [Node-RED Forum](https://discourse.nodered.org) or [slack team](https://nodered.org/slack).

        You could also consider asking a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node-red) and tag it `node-red`.

        That way the whole Node-RED user community can help, rather than rely on the core development team.

        To help us understand the issue, please fill-in as much of the following information as you can:
